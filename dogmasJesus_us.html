                        The dogma of the divinity of Christ proclaims that Jesus Christ is true God, consubstantial with the Father. He is not merely a prophet or a special man, but the very Son of God, the second Person of the Holy Trinity, who became incarnate to save humanity.

                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In response to the Arian heresy that denied the divinity of Christ, the Council of Nicaea defined that Jesus is "consubstantial with the Father" (homoousios), establishing that He is true God from all eternity.</p>

                        The dogma of the humanity of Christ affirms that Jesus Christ is true man, possessing a complete human nature, body and soul, except for sin. He experienced all human limitations, except error and sin, being true God and true man.

                        The dogma of the hypostatic union proclaims that in Jesus Christ the two natures, divine and human, are united in one Person (hypostasis), the Person of the Word. The natures do not mix or confuse, but remain distinct in a perfect union.

                        The dogma of redemption affirms that Jesus Christ, through his passion, death, and resurrection, redeemed humanity from sin and eternal death. His death on the cross was a voluntary and effective sacrifice that reconciled man with God and opened the gates of heaven.

                        The dogma of the resurrection proclaims that Jesus Christ rose from the dead on the third day after his crucifixion.

                        The dogma of the ascension affirms that Jesus Christ, forty days after his resurrection, ascended into heaven in body and soul, sitting at the right hand of the Father.
