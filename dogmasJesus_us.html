                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> Christ possesses the infinite Divine Nature with all its infinite Perfections, for having been eternally generated by God. Jesus Christ is true God, consubstantial with the Father, not merely a prophet or a special man, but the very Son of God, the second Person of the Holy Trinity.
                    </p>

                        <p><strong>When it was proclaimed:</strong> First Council of Nicaea (325 AD)</p>
                        <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Church Fathers, especially Saint Athanasius</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In response to the Arian heresy that denied the divinity of Christ, the Council of Nicaea defined that Jesus is "consubstantial with the Father" (homoousios), establishing that He is true God from all eternity.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> The Council of Chalcedon (451, IV) declares: "Our Lord Jesus Christ, Himself perfect in Divinity and Himself perfect in humanity (...) which must be recognized in two natures: without confusion, without change, without division, without separation and in no way is the difference of nature abolished because of the union, each nature preserving its property and concurring in one Person" (Dz. 148). Christ is the possessor of an integral Divine Nature and an integral human nature.

                        <p><strong>When it was proclaimed:</strong> Council of Chalcedon (451 AD)</p>
                        <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Saint Leo the Great, Fathers of the Council of Chalcedon</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In response to heresies that denied the true humanity of Christ (Docetism) or affirmed only one nature (Monophysitism), the Church defined that Christ possesses two complete natures: divine and human, united without confusion.</p>
                        <p class="dogma-quote"><strong>Official or biblical citation:</strong> "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us." (John 1:14) / "Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness." (Philippians 2:6-7)</p>
                        <p class="dogma-spiritual"><strong>Spiritual application:</strong> Recognize in Christ the perfect union of the divine and the human, model of our own redeemed humanity.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> The Third Council of Constantinople (680-681) declares: "We proclaim, according to the teachings of the Holy Fathers, that there are two physical wills and two physical operations, in an indivisible way, in a non-convertible way, in an inseparable way and in a non-confused way. And these two physical wills do not oppose each other." Despite the physical duality of the two wills, there existed and exists moral unity, because the human will of Christ conforms in free subordination, in a most perfect way, to the Divine Will.

                        <p><strong>When it was proclaimed:</strong> Third Council of Constantinople (680-681 AD)</p>
                        <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Fathers of the Third Council of Constantinople, against Monothelitism</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In response to the Monothelite heresy that affirmed that Christ had only one will (divine), the Council defined that Christ possesses two wills: one divine and one human, which are perfectly harmonized.</p>
                        <p class="dogma-quote"><strong>Official or biblical citation:</strong> "Not as I will, but as you will." (Matthew 26:39) / "I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me." (John 6:38)</p>

                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> Jesus Christ, even though possessing complete human nature, is the Natural Son of God the Father by nature, not by adoption. His divine sonship is eternal and essential, not acquired. He is the Son of God from all eternity, even before the incarnation.

                        <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Church Fathers, especially against Arianism and Adoptionism</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> The Church has always defended that Christ is the Son of God by nature, not by adoption, establishing that his divine sonship is eternal and essential to his person.</p>
                        <p class="dogma-quote"><strong>Official or biblical citation:</strong> "But when the set time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those under the law, that we might receive adoption to sonship." (Galatians 4:4-5)</p>

                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> In the ineffable Mystery, Christ, by his human nature, was at the same time Priest and Offering, but by his Divine Nature, together with the Father and the Holy Spirit, was the Same One who received the Sacrifice. The death of Christ on the cross was a true sacrifice, offered voluntarily for the salvation of humanity.

                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> The Church has always taught that the death of Christ was a true sacrifice, establishing that Christ is at the same time priest, victim, and altar of the redemptive sacrifice.</p>

                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> Jesus Christ willed to offer Himself to God the Father, as a Sacrifice presented on the altar of the Cross in his Death, to obtain for us eternal forgiveness.
