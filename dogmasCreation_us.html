                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        The dogma of creation from nothing (ex nihilo) proclaims that God created the universe and everything in it from nothing, without using pre-existing matter. Creation is not a transformation of something already existing, but a free and loving action of God that brought into existence everything that exists.
                    </p>
                    <div class="dogma-info">
                        <p><strong>Biblical basis:</strong> Genesis 1:1, Hebrews 11:3</p>
                        <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Church Fathers, especially against Gnostic dualism</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In response to philosophies that affirmed the eternity of matter or the existence of an evil principle coeternal with God, the Church defined that everything was created from nothing by the free and omnipotent will of God.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        The dogma of the goodness of creation affirms that everything God created is good in itself. Creation reflects the goodness and wisdom of the Creator, and evil does not come from creation, but from the improper use of freedom by rational creatures.

                        <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Saint Augustine, against Manichaeism</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In response to dualistic doctrines that considered matter as evil by nature, the Church affirmed that all creation is good and that evil is a privation of good, not a substance created by God.</p>

                    <h2 class="dogma-title">Divine Providence</h2>
                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        The dogma of divine providence proclaims that God not only created the world, but continues to govern it and care for all his creatures. His providence extends to all events, great and small, guiding everything to the final good.

                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> The doctrine of providence was developed to explain how God can be sovereign over history while still preserving human freedom, establishing that divine providence does not annul, but realizes the freedom of creatures.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        The dogma of the creation of angels affirms that angels are purely spiritual creatures created by God before the creation of the material world. They are intelligent and free beings, servants of God and messengers to men, created to worship and serve the Creator.
                    </p>

                        <p><strong>Proclaimed:</strong> Fourth Lateran Council (1215), First Vatican Council (1870)</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> The existence of angels was always accepted by the Church, but was defined dogmatically in response to philosophical questions, establishing that they are spiritual creatures distinct from God and men.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        The dogma of the creation of time affirms that time was created together with the universe. God exists in eternity, outside of time, and created time as part of creation. Time had a beginning and will have an end, while God is eternal.

                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In response to philosophies that affirmed the eternity of the world, the Church defined that time was created by God and that the universe had a beginning, establishing the distinction between the eternity of God and the temporality of creation.</p>

                        The dogma of the purpose of creation proclaims that God created the world to manifest his glory and so that creatures, especially men, may know Him, love Him, and serve Him, thus achieving eternal happiness in union with Him.

                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> The purpose of creation was always understood as the glory of God and the good of creatures. This doctrine establishes that creation is not the result of chance, but of a loving plan of God to share his life and happiness with creatures.</p>
