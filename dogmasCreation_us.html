                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> The creation of the world, from nothing, is not only a fundamental truth of Christian Revelation, but at the same time reason can reach it with only its natural forces, based, for example, on Cosmological Arguments: Argument of the First Cause and Argument of Contingency. Creation is not a transformation of something already existing, but a free and loving action of God that brought into existence everything that exists.
                    </p>
                    <div class="dogma-info">
                        <p><strong>When it was proclaimed:</strong> Information not officially recorded.</p>
                        <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Church Fathers, especially against Gnostic dualism</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In response to philosophies that affirmed the eternity of matter or the existence of an evil principle coeternal with God, the Church defined that everything was created from nothing by the free and omnipotent will of God.</p>
                        <p class="dogma-quote"><strong>Official or biblical citation:</strong> "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." (Genesis 1:1) / "By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God's command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible." (Hebrews 11:3)</p>
                        <p class="dogma-spiritual"><strong>Spiritual application:</strong> Recognize the greatness and power of God as Creator, and live with gratitude for the gift of existence and creation.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> The world had a beginning in time, for the Infinite is capable of creating the finite, and the Eternal is capable of giving existence to the temporal. Time was created together with the universe. God exists in eternity, outside of time, and created time as part of creation. Time had a beginning and will have an end, while God is eternal.

                        <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Saint Augustine, Saint Thomas Aquinas and other Church Fathers and Scholastics</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In response to philosophies that affirmed the eternity of the world, the Church defined that time was created by God and that the universe had a beginning, establishing the distinction between the eternity of God and the temporality of creation.</p>
                        <p class="dogma-quote"><strong>Official or biblical citation:</strong> "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." (Genesis 1:1) / "Before the mountains were born or you brought forth the whole world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God." (Psalm 90:2)</p>
                        <p class="dogma-spiritual"><strong>Spiritual application:</strong> Live conscious of the temporality of creation and the eternity of God, seeking eternal values that transcend time.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> Besides being Creator, God is Conservator, for he conserves in Existence all created things. God not only created the world, but continues to govern it and care for all his creatures. His providence extends to all events, great and small, guiding everything toward the final good.

                        <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Church Fathers, Scholastics, especially Saint Thomas Aquinas</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> The doctrine of providence was developed to explain how God can be sovereign over history and still preserve human freedom, establishing that divine providence does not annul, but realizes the freedom of creatures.</p>
                        <p class="dogma-quote"><strong>Official or biblical citation:</strong> "He sustains all things by his powerful word." (Hebrews 1:3) / "For in him we live and move and have our being." (Acts 17:28)</p>
                        <p class="dogma-spiritual"><strong>Spiritual application:</strong> Trust in divine providence, recognizing that God cares for all things and that nothing happens without his permission, always seeking his will.</p>
