                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> It is enough to indicate the guilt of conscience to a properly ordained priest, through secret confession.

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> Transubstantiation is a conversion in the passive sense; it is the passage from one thing to another. The substances of Bread and Wine cease, for in their places succeed the Body and Blood of Christ. Transubstantiation is a miraculous and singular conversion different from natural conversions, because not only the matter but also the form of bread and wine are converted; only the accidents remain unchanged: we continue to see and experience physically bread and wine, but substantially they are no longer so, because in them is really the Body, the Blood, the Soul and the Divinity of Our Lord Jesus Christ.

                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> The Council of Trent defined the doctrine of transubstantiation to explain how bread and wine are truly transformed into the Body and Blood of Christ, maintaining only the sensible appearances.</p>
                        <p class="dogma-quote"><strong>Official or biblical citation:</strong> "Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ?" (1 Corinthians 10:16) / "Everyone ought to examine themselves before they eat of the bread and drink from the cup. For those who eat and drink without discerning the body of Christ eat and drink judgment on themselves." (1 Corinthians 11:28-30)</p>
                        <p class="dogma-spiritual"><strong>Spiritual application:</strong> Adore Christ present in the Eucharist, recognizing that under the appearances of bread and wine the Lord is really present, and receive communion with faith and reverence.</p>
