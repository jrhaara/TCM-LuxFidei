                <p>Dogmas about the sacraments reveal that they are effective signs of grace, instituted by Christ and entrusted to the Church. These dogmas include the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, the efficacy of the sacraments, and the seven sacraments of the Church.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        The dogma of the Eucharist proclaims that in the Eucharist, the bread and wine are truly transformed into the Body and Blood of Christ (transubstantiation). Christ is really present, substantially, under the appearances of bread and wine. The Eucharist is the central sacrament of the Church, instituted by Christ at the Last Supper.

                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In response to theories that denied the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, the Council of Trent dogmatically defined transubstantiation, establishing that Christ is truly present in the sacrament.</p>

                        The dogma of Baptism affirms that baptism is necessary for salvation, erases original sin and all personal sins, confers sanctifying grace, and incorporates the baptized into the Church. Baptism imprints an indelible character on the soul, being valid only once.

                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In response to movements that denied the necessity of baptism or that defended rebaptism, the Church defined that baptism is necessary for salvation and confers grace ex opere operato.</p>

                        The dogma of Confirmation proclaims that this sacrament confers the Holy Spirit in a special way, strengthening the baptized to witness the faith and live as a mature Christian. Confirmation imprints an indelible character and completes baptismal grace.

                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> Confirmation was always recognized as a sacrament distinct from baptism, being defined by the Council of Trent as one of the seven sacraments instituted by Christ.</p>

                        The dogma of Penance (Reconciliation) affirms that this sacrament forgives sins committed after baptism. The priest, acting in the name of Christ, absolves the sins of the penitent who repents, confesses, and has purpose of amendment. Individual confession is necessary for grave sins.

                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In response to theories that denied the necessity of confession or the power to forgive sins, the Council of Trent defined that confession is necessary and that priests have power to absolve sins.</p>

                        The dogma of the Anointing of the Sick proclaims that this sacrament confers special grace to the sick and elderly in danger of death. The anointing with consecrated oil strengthens the soul, forgives venial sins, and can restore physical health if it is God's will.

                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> The anointing of the sick was always practiced by the Church. The Council of Trent defined it as a sacrament, and the Second Vatican Council reformulated its practice, extending it not only to the dying, but to all seriously ill.</p>

                        The dogma of Holy Orders affirms that this sacrament confers the sacred power to serve the Church as bishop, presbyter, or deacon. Matrimony is the sacrament that unites a man and a woman in an indissoluble union, a symbol of the union of Christ with the Church. Both imprint an indelible character.

                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In response to movements that denied the sacramental character of orders and matrimony, the Council of Trent defined both as sacraments instituted by Christ, establishing their characteristics and effects.</p>
