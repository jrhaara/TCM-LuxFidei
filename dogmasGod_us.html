                <p>Dogmas about God reveal fundamental truths about the divine nature, the Trinity, and God's relationship with creation. These dogmas form the foundation of all Catholic theology and express what the Church believes and teaches about the Supreme Being.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> Human beings are capable of knowing God through natural reason, by contemplating creation. The existence of God is a truth evident through the order, beauty, and purpose of the universe. The idea of God is not inherent in us, since it transcends human nature, but we have a natural capacity to know Him, in a certain spontaneous way, through His work.
                    </p>
                    <div class="dogma-info">
                        <p><strong>When it was proclaimed:</strong> There was no single date; reaffirmed in various councils and in the constant Magisterium of the Church.</p>
                        <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Various Church Fathers, such as Saint Augustine and Saint Thomas Aquinas.</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> Since the first centuries, the Church defended the existence of God against materialism and philosophical atheism.</p>
                        <p class="dogma-quote"><strong>Official or biblical citation:</strong> "The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands." (Psalm 19:1)</p>
                        <p class="dogma-spiritual"><strong>Spiritual application:</strong> Invite the faithful to recognize God in all things and to live with gratitude for creation.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> However, the existence of God is not only an object of natural reason's knowledge, but also and mainly it is an object of supernatural faith. Faith transcends reason and allows a deeper and more certain knowledge of God's existence.
                    </p>
                    <div class="dogma-info">
                        <p><strong>When it was proclaimed:</strong> Information not officially recorded.</p>
                        <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Church Fathers and theologians who developed the doctrine of supernatural faith.</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> The Church has always taught that faith is a supernatural gift that allows knowing God in a higher way than natural reason.</p>
                        <p class="dogma-quote"><strong>Official or biblical citation:</strong> "And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him." (Hebrews 11:6)</p>
                        <p class="dogma-spiritual"><strong>Spiritual application:</strong> Cultivate faith as a gift from God that allows us to know and love God in a supernatural way.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> There is no more than one single God. This fundamental truth distinguishes Christian monotheism from other forms of belief and establishes that there are no other gods besides the one God revealed in Scripture.
                    </p>
                    <div class="dogma-info">
                        <p><strong>When it was proclaimed:</strong> Since the first centuries of the Church, confirmed in various councils.</p>
                        <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Apostolic Fathers and Apologists, especially against pagan polytheism.</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In a polytheistic world, the early Church firmly defended the oneness of God, distinguishing itself from both paganism and heretical interpretations that suggested multiple deities.</p>
                        <p class="dogma-quote"><strong>Official or biblical citation:</strong> "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one." (Deuteronomy 6:4) / "The Lord our God is the one Lord." (Mark 12:29)</p>
                        <p class="dogma-spiritual"><strong>Spiritual application:</strong> Worship and serve exclusively the one true God, rejecting all forms of idolatry.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> God has no beginning or end, is beyond space and time as we are able to experience and conceive them. He exists from always and forever, without beginning or end, transcending time and not being subject to the temporal limitations of creation.
                    </p>
                    <div class="dogma-info">
                        <p><strong>When it was proclaimed:</strong> Information not officially recorded.</p>
                        <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Saint Augustine, Saint Thomas Aquinas and other Church Fathers and Scholastics.</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In response to philosophical questions about the nature of time and eternity, the Church defined that God exists in a present eternity, without past or future, being the creator of time itself.</p>
                        <p class="dogma-quote"><strong>Official or biblical citation:</strong> "Before the mountains were born or you brought forth the whole world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God." (Psalm 90:2) / "I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty." (Revelation 1:8)</p>
                        <p class="dogma-spiritual"><strong>Spiritual application:</strong> Trust in the immutability and eternity of God, source of security and hope for the faithful.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> In the One God there are three Persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Each one possesses the immutable Divine Essence. The dogma of the Holy Trinity affirms that there is one God in three distinct Persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Each Person is fully God, but they are not three gods, but one God in three Persons.
                    </p>
                    <div class="dogma-info">
                        <p><strong>When it was proclaimed:</strong> First Council of Nicaea (325 AD) and First Council of Constantinople (381 AD)</p>
                        <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Church Fathers, especially Saint Athanasius and the Cappadocians (Saint Basil, Saint Gregory of Nyssa, Saint Gregory Nazianzen).</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In response to Arian heresies that denied the divinity of Christ, the Church clearly defined the Trinitarian doctrine, establishing that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are consubstantial and coeternal.</p>
                        <p class="dogma-quote"><strong>Official or biblical citation:</strong> "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." (Matthew 28:19) / "May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all." (2 Corinthians 13:13)</p>
                        <p class="dogma-spiritual"><strong>Spiritual application:</strong> Worship the One and Triune God, recognizing the equality and distinction of the three Divine Persons, and live in communion that reflects the Trinitarian life.</p>
