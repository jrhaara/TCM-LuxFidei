                <p>Dogmas about God reveal fundamental truths about the divine nature, the Trinity, and God's relationship with creation. These dogmas form the foundation of all Catholic theology and express what the Church believes and teaches about the Supreme Being.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        The dogma of the Holy Trinity affirms that there is one God in three distinct Persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Each Person is fully God, but they are not three gods, but one God in three Persons. This truth was revealed by Jesus Christ and developed by the early councils of the Church.

                        <p><strong>Proclaimed:</strong> First Council of Nicaea (325 AD) and First Council of Constantinople (381 AD)</p>
                        <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Church Fathers, especially Saint Athanasius and the Cappadocians</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In response to Arian heresies that denied the divinity of Christ, the Church clearly defined the Trinitarian doctrine, establishing that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are consubstantial and coeternal.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        The dogma of the unity of God proclaims that there is only one true God, omnipotent, omniscient, and eternal. This fundamental truth distinguishes Christian monotheism from other forms of belief and establishes that there are no other gods besides the one God revealed in Scripture.

                        <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Apostolic Fathers and Apologists</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In a polytheistic world, the early Church firmly defended the oneness of God, distinguishing itself from both paganism and heretical interpretations that suggested multiple deities.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        The dogma of the eternity of God affirms that God exists from always and forever, without beginning or end. He transcends time and is not subject to the temporal limitations of creation. This truth expresses the timeless and immutable nature of the Divine Being.

                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In response to philosophical questions about the nature of time and eternity, the Church defined that God exists in a present eternity, without past or future, being the creator of time itself.</p>

                        The dogma of the omniscience of God proclaims that God knows all things: the past, present, and future, both what is and what could be. His knowledge is perfect, complete, and immediate, encompassing all events, thoughts, and possibilities.

                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> The doctrine of divine omniscience was developed to explain how God can be sovereign over history while still preserving human free will, establishing that God's knowledge does not determine human actions.</p>

                        The dogma of the omnipotence of God affirms that God is all-powerful and can do everything that is logically possible and in accordance with his nature. His power knows no limits, except those that derive from his own divine essence and perfection.

                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> The doctrine of omnipotence was defined to distinguish the absolute power of God from the limitations of creatures, establishing that God can accomplish anything that does not contradict his holy and just nature.</p>

                        The dogma of the goodness of God proclaims that God is infinitely good, loving, and merciful. His goodness is perfect and manifests itself in all his works, especially in creation, redemption, and the providence he exercises over all creatures.
