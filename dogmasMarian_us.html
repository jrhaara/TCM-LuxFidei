                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> The Most Holy Virgin Mary, at the first instant of her conception was, by singular Grace and Privilege of Almighty God, in view of the Merits of Christ Jesus, Savior of the human race, preserved immune from all stain of original guilt. The doctrine of the Perpetual Virginity of Mary expresses the "real and perpetual virginity of Mary even in the act of giving birth to Jesus, the Son of God made man." Mary remained always a virgin (in Greek: ἀειπαρθένος – aeiparthenos), making Jesus her only Son, whose Conception and Birth are miraculous.

                    <div class="dogma-info">
                        <p><strong>When it was proclaimed:</strong> Immaculate Conception: Pope Pius IX, Bull "Ineffabilis Deus" (December 8, 1854). Perpetual Virginity: Lateran Council (649), confirmed by the Council of Trent</p>
                        <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Immaculate Conception: Scholastics, especially Duns Scotus. Perpetual Virginity: Church Fathers, especially against Helvidius and Jovinian</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> The Immaculate Conception was defined after centuries of theological debate. The Perpetual Virginity has always been defended by the Church since the first centuries, being widely supported by the Church Fathers already in the 300s.</p>
                        <p class="dogma-quote"><strong>Official or biblical citation:</strong> "Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you." (Luke 1:28) / "How will this be," Mary asked the angel, "since I am a virgin?" (Luke 1:34) / "The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son." (Isaiah 7:14)</p>
                        <p class="dogma-spiritual"><strong>Spiritual application:</strong> Venerate Mary as a model of purity and holiness, seeking to imitate her obedience and fidelity to God, and trust in her maternal intercession.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> Mary gave birth to Christ according to human nature, but he who was born of her transcends this human nature – The Son of Mary is properly the Divine Word, incarnate in human nature – Mary, then, is necessarily the mother of God, since Jesus, the Word, is God: Christ, being inseparably true God and true Man, makes Mary the true mother of God, since there is no separation between the human and divine Natures in Our Lord and Savior. Obviously, Mary is not prior to Almighty God and Creator of all things, nor is she a "goddess." Mary is not and could not be the mother of God according to the Divine Nature; however, since the two Natures in Christ are inseparable, she was made, by an inscrutable Mystery of God Himself, at the same time creature, servant, daughter and mother of the Lord.

                    <div class="dogma-info">
                        <p><strong>When it was proclaimed:</strong> Council of Ephesus (431 AD)</p>
                        <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Saint Cyril of Alexandria, against Nestorius</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In response to the Nestorian heresy that separated the two natures of Christ, the Council of Ephesus proclaimed Mary as Theotokos (Mother of God), establishing that she is the mother of the divine Person of Christ.</p>
                        <p class="dogma-quote"><strong>Official or biblical citation:</strong> "But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?" (Luke 1:43) / "But when the set time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman." (Galatians 4:4)</p>
                        <p class="dogma-spiritual"><strong>Spiritual application:</strong> Honor Mary as Mother of God, recognizing her unique dignity and trusting in her powerful intercession with her divine Son.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> The Virgin Mary was assumed into Heaven immediately after the end of her earthly life; her body did not suffer corruption as will happen with the men and women who will rise until the end of times, passing through decomposition. The Assumption of Our Lady was transmitted by the written and oral Tradition of the Church. It is not found explicitly in Sacred Scripture, but it is implicit there. Various Holy Fathers of the Church attest that the Apostles were miraculously taken to Jerusalem on the night that would precede the passing of the Blessed Virgin Mary. By the Virtue of her Son, the Holy Virgin had risen. Angels took her immaculate body and transported it to Heaven, where she lives in ineffable Glory.

                        <p><strong>When it was proclaimed:</strong> Pope Pius XII, Apostolic Constitution "Munificentissimus Deus" (November 1, 1950)</p>
                        <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Tradition of the Church since the first centuries, especially Saint John Damascene</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> Although the Assumption of Mary was believed since the first centuries and reported at the general Council of Chalcedon in 451, it was defined dogmatically in 1950, establishing that Mary, for being Mother of God and Immaculate, was preserved from the corruption of the tomb.</p>
                        <p class="dogma-quote"><strong>Official or biblical citation:</strong> "At your right hand is the royal bride in gold of Ophir." (Psalm 45:9) / "A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head." (Revelation 12:1)</p>
                        <p class="dogma-spiritual"><strong>Spiritual application:</strong> Contemplate Mary as firstfruits of the resurrection, hope of our own resurrection, and ask for her intercession to reach heavenly glory.</p>
