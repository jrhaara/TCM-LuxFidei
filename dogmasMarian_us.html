                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        The dogma of the Divine Maternity proclaims that Mary is truly the Mother of God (Theotokos). She is not only the mother of Christ's humanity, but the mother of the divine Person of the incarnate Word. This dogma establishes Mary's unique relationship with the Holy Trinity and her exceptional dignity.

                        <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Saint Cyril of Alexandria, against Nestorius</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In response to the Nestorian heresy that separated the two natures of Christ, the Council of Ephesus proclaimed Mary as Theotokos (Mother of God), establishing that she is the mother of the divine Person of Christ.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        The dogma of the Perpetual Virginity of Mary affirms that she remained a virgin before, during, and after the birth of Jesus. This triple virginity (ante partum, in partu, post partum) is a sign of the miraculous action of the Holy Spirit and the divinity of Christ.
                    </p>
                    <div class="dogma-info">
                        <p><strong>Proclaimed:</strong> Lateran Council (649), confirmed by the Council of Trent</p>
                        <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Church Fathers, especially against Helvidius and Jovinian</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In response to theories that denied Mary's virginity, especially after the birth of Jesus, the Church defined that Mary always remained a virgin, establishing this privilege as part of Catholic faith.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        The dogma of the Immaculate Conception proclaims that Mary was preserved from original sin from the first moment of her conception, by a special privilege of God in view of the merits of Christ. She was redeemed in a preventive way, being full of grace from the beginning.
                    </p>

                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> After centuries of theological debate about how Mary could be redeemed without having original sin, Pope Pius IX dogmatically defined that Mary was preserved from original sin from her conception.</p>

                    <h2 class="dogma-title">The Assumption</h2>
                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        The dogma of the Assumption proclaims that Mary, at the end of her earthly life, was taken up body and soul into heavenly glory. She did not experience the corruption of the tomb and was assumed into heaven, where she reigns as Queen of Heaven and Earth.
                    </p>

                        <p><strong>Proclaimed:</strong> Pope Pius XII, Apostolic Constitution "Munificentissimus Deus" (November 1, 1950)</p>
                        <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Church tradition from the earliest centuries</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> Although the Assumption of Mary was believed from the earliest centuries, it was dogmatically defined in 1950, establishing that Mary, being the Mother of God and Immaculate, was preserved from the corruption of the tomb.</p>
