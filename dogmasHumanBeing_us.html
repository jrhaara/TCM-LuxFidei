                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> This dogma was affirmed at the Fourth Lateran Council (1215), under Innocent III (1198-1216), and at the First Vatican Council (1869-70), under Pius IX (1846-78). According to the doctrine of the Church, the body is an essentially constituent part of human nature, and not a burden and hindrance as certain heretics said. The Council of Constantinople declared "that man has only one rational and intellectual soul" (Dz. 338). The spiritual soul is the principle of spiritual life and at the same time of animal life (vegetative and sensitive).

                        <p><strong>When it was proclaimed:</strong> Fourth Lateran Council (1215), First Vatican Council (1869-1870)</p>
                        <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Church Fathers, especially against Manichaeism and other heresies</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In response to theories that denied the unity of the human being or that considered the body as evil, the Church defined that man is a unity of body and soul, both created good by God.</p>
                        <p class="dogma-quote"><strong>Official or biblical citation:</strong> "The Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life." (Genesis 2:7) / "Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell." (Matthew 10:28)</p>
                        <p class="dogma-spiritual"><strong>Spiritual application:</strong> Respect the dignity of body and soul, caring for both as gifts from God, and live the unity of the human person created in the image of God.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> Sin, which is death of the soul, propagates from Adam to all his descendants by generation, and not by imitation, being inherent in each individual. All human beings are born with original sin, inherited from Adam and Eve. This sin is not a personal act, but a condition that deprives the soul of sanctifying grace and inclines the human being to evil, although it does not completely destroy the goodness of human nature.

                        <p><strong>When it was proclaimed:</strong> Council of Carthage (418), Council of Trent (1546)</p>
                        <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Saint Augustine, against Pelagianism</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In response to Pelagianism that denied original sin, the Church defined that all are born with this condition, establishing the universal need for Christ's redemption and baptism for the remission of original sin.</p>
                        <p class="dogma-quote"><strong>Official or biblical citation:</strong> "Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned." (Romans 5:12) / "Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me." (Psalm 51:5)</p>
                        <p class="dogma-spiritual"><strong>Spiritual application:</strong> Recognize our condition as sinners and the need for God's grace, seeking baptism and continuous conversion through the sacraments.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> Only a free act on the part of Divine Love could restore the supernatural order, destroyed by Sin. Being God infinitely Great, Just and Perfect, the crime against Him is infinitely grave. It could only then be redeemed through an infinitely meritorious and reparatory Sacrifice, of which we would not be capable. The human being, by his own strength, cannot save himself.

                    <div class="dogma-info">
                        <p><strong>When it was proclaimed:</strong> Information not officially recorded.</p>
                        <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Church Fathers, especially against Pelagianism and Semi-Pelagianism</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In response to theories that affirmed that man can save himself by his own strength, the Church has always defended that salvation is a free gift from God, obtained through Christ, and that man needs divine grace to be saved.</p>
                        <p class="dogma-quote"><strong>Official or biblical citation:</strong> "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast." (Ephesians 2:8-9) / "Apart from me you can do nothing." (John 15:5)</p>
                        <p class="dogma-spiritual"><strong>Spiritual application:</strong> Recognize our total dependence on God for salvation, welcoming divine grace and cooperating with it through faith and good works.</p>
