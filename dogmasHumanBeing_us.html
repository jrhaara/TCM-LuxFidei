                        The dogma of the image and likeness of God proclaims that the human being was created in the image and likeness of God. This image is manifested in rational capacity, freedom, the ability to love, and the vocation to communion with God. Human dignity derives from this special relationship with the Creator.

                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> This truth was always defended by the Church, establishing the unique dignity of the human being and his vocation to holiness and eternal communion with God.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        The dogma of the origin of the soul affirms that each human soul is created directly by God at the moment of conception. The soul is not transmitted by parents (traducianism), nor does it pre-exist (pre-existence), but is created by God for each individual person, being immortal and spiritual.

                        <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Against traducianist theories and pre-existence</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In response to theories that denied the direct creation of the soul by God, the Church defined that each soul is created immediately by God, establishing the divine origin and immortality of the human soul.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        The dogma of original sin proclaims that all human beings are born with original sin, inherited from Adam and Eve. This sin is not a personal act, but a condition that deprives the soul of sanctifying grace and inclines the human being to evil, although it does not completely destroy the goodness of human nature.

                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In response to Pelagianism that denied original sin, the Church defined that all are born with this condition, establishing the universal need for Christ's redemption and baptism for the remission of original sin.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        The dogma of human dignity affirms that each human person possesses an inviolable and inalienable dignity, derived from his creation in the image of God and the redemption of Christ. This dignity grounds human rights and the obligation to respect all human life from conception to natural death.

                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> Human dignity was always defended by the Church, especially against slavery, discrimination, and violence. It was reaffirmed at the Second Vatican Council and in papal documents on human rights.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        The dogma of free will proclaims that the human being possesses true freedom to choose between good and evil. This freedom, although wounded by original sin, was not destroyed and can be restored by the grace of God. Free will is essential for moral responsibility and the possibility of merit.
                    </p>
                    <div class="dogma-info">
                        <p><strong>Proclaimed:</strong> Council of Trent (1546), against determinism and fatalism</p>
                        <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Church Fathers, especially against Manichaeism and determinism</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In response to philosophies that denied human freedom (determinism, fatalism), the Church always defended free will, establishing that human freedom and divine grace cooperate in salvation.</p>

                        The dogma of the immortality of the soul affirms that the human soul is immortal and does not perish with the death of the body. After death, the soul continues to exist and receives a particular judgment, awaiting the final resurrection of the body at the end of time, when body and soul will be reunited forever.

                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> The immortality of the soul was always part of Christian faith, distinguishing itself from materialist philosophies. It was defined against theories that denied the survival of the soul after death.</p>
