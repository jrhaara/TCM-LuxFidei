                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> To understand this dogma, it is good to remember: the subject of papal infallibility is every legitimate Pope, in his capacity as successor of Peter. The object of infallibility is the truths of faith and morals, revealed or in intimate connection with Divine Revelation. The condition of infallibility is that the Pope speak ex cathedra, that is: that he speak as pastor and teacher of all the faithful making use of his supreme authority, and that he have the intention of defining some doctrine of faith or morals to be believed by all the faithful. The reason for infallibility is the supernatural assistance of the Holy Spirit, which preserves the supreme teacher of the Church from all error.
