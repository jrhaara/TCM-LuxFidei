                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        The dogma of papal infallibility proclaims that the Pope, when speaking ex cathedra (from the throne of Peter) on matters of faith and morals, is preserved from error by the Holy Spirit. This infallibility does not extend to personal or political matters, but only to solemn declarations on doctrine.

                        <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Medieval and modern theologians, especially against Gallicanism</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In response to movements that questioned the Pope's authority, the First Vatican Council defined that the Pope possesses infallibility when speaking officially on faith and morals, establishing the limits and conditions of this prerogative.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        The dogma of the authority of the magisterium affirms that the Church, through the Pope and the bishops in communion with him, has authority to authentically interpret divine Revelation and teach with authority on matters of faith and morals. This authority derives from Christ and is assisted by the Holy Spirit.

                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> The authority of the magisterium was always recognized by the Church as necessary to preserve revealed truth. It was reaffirmed in the Councils against movements that denied this authority.</p>

                        The dogma of the Church as the Mystical Body of Christ proclaims that the Church is not merely a human organization, but the mystical body of Christ, of which He is the Head and the faithful are the members. This organic and spiritual union unites all the baptized in a supernatural communion.

                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> The doctrine of the Mystical Body was developed by Saint Paul and has always been part of Catholic faith, establishing the spiritual and organic nature of the Church as a communion of faithful united to Christ.</p>

                        The dogma of the unity of the Church affirms that the Church of Christ is one, possessing one faith, one baptism, one Eucharist, and one authority. This visible unity is manifested in communion with the Pope and the bishops, and in the profession of the same faith.

                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> The unity of the Church was always defended against schisms and divisions. It was reaffirmed at the Second Vatican Council, establishing that unity is a gift from Christ and an obligation of all the faithful.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        The dogma of the holiness of the Church proclaims that the Church is holy because it was founded by Christ, is guided by the Holy Spirit, and possesses the means of sanctification (sacraments, doctrine). Although its members are sinners, the Church itself is holy and produces saints.

                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In response to Donatism that denied the holiness of the Church due to the sins of its members, the Church defined that the holiness of the Church does not depend on the holiness of the faithful, but on its divine origin and means of grace.</p>

                        The dogma of apostolicity affirms that the Church is apostolic because it was founded on the Apostles, preserves and transmits apostolic teaching, and is governed by the successors of the Apostles (the bishops) in communion with the successor of Peter (the Pope).

                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> Apostolicity was always defended as proof of the authenticity of the Catholic Church, establishing apostolic succession as a guarantee of continuity with the primitive Church founded by Christ.</p>
