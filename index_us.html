          <p>What are Catholic Dogmas</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <p>Dogmas are fundamental truths of the Catholic faith, proclaimed by the Church as revealed by God. They clearly express the core of Christian belief, serving as firm points amid the uncertainties of the world.</p>
            <p>In the Church's tradition, a dogma is not merely an idea or theological interpretation, but a divine truth recognized and confirmed by the authority and light of the Holy Spirit. They preserve the heart of the Gospel, preventing Christ’s message from being lost among cultural trends or passing opinions.</p>
            <p>Over the centuries, these dogmas have become the pillars that sustain the unity of the Church and the shared understanding of God, Christ, Mary, and salvation itself. Through them, the faithful find a safe path to comprehend divine mystery, knowing they follow not human opinion, but revealed truth.</p>

          <p>The Purpose of Dogmas</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <p>Dogmas aim to guide and protect Christian faith, serving as steady lights that direct the believer’s path throughout history. They keep the essence of the Gospel alive, reminding each generation of what God revealed to humanity through Christ.</p>
            <p>Across centuries, the Church has faced doubts, cultural challenges, and new interpretations of faith. In every age, dogmas have been the reference point preventing the essential from being lost or distorted. More than theological statements, they are a tool of communion — ensuring that all believers, regardless of time or place, share one truth.</p>
            <p>Thus, dogmas are not boundaries but beacons. They do not imprison thought but point the right way through the vast sea of reason and faith. To understand and accept dogmas is to understand and welcome God Himself revealed.</p>

          <p>Dogma vs. Doctrine vs. Discipline</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <p>Although similar, dogma, doctrine, and discipline have different meanings in Church life. A dogma is a divine, immutable, and absolute truth — a certainty of faith recognized as revealed by God. Doctrine, on the other hand, is the broader body of teachings and theological reflections that help understand those truths.</p>
            <p>Doctrine deepens, grows, and expresses itself in new ways through the centuries, always in harmony with dogmas. Discipline refers to pastoral norms and practices adopted by the Church at different times — such as fasting, liturgical forms, or canonical obligations. These can change because they are human instruments of organization, not eternal truths.</p>
            <p>Understanding the difference between these three levels is essential to see how Catholic faith remains both firm and alive. Dogma gives solidity; doctrine gives depth; discipline gives movement. From this harmony arises a Church that preserves the eternal while engaging the present.</p>
