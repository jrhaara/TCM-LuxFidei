                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        The dogma of death and judgment proclaims that each person, upon dying, receives an immediate particular judgment, in which God determines their eternal destiny based on their actions, faith, and state of grace. This particular judgment precedes the universal final judgment that will occur at the end of time.
                    </p>

                        <p><strong>Biblical basis:</strong> Luke 16:22-23, Hebrews 9:27, 2 Corinthians 5:10</p>
                        <p><strong>Proclaimed:</strong> From the earliest centuries, confirmed by the Councils</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> The doctrine of particular judgment was always part of Christian faith, establishing that death is not the end, but the beginning of eternal life, whether in heaven, purgatory, or hell.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        The dogma of heaven proclaims that heaven is the state of eternal and perfect happiness in the presence of God. Those who die in a state of grace and without mortal sin enter immediately into heaven, where they enjoy the beatific vision, seeing God face to face and participating in his divine life.

                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> Heaven was always understood as the final destination of the just. The Council of Florence defined that the souls of the saints enter immediately into heaven after death, enjoying the beatific vision.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        The dogma of purgatory proclaims that there exists a state of purification after death for those who die in a state of grace, but with unforgiven venial sins or with temporal debt of already forgiven sins. Purgatory is temporary and ends when the soul is completely purified.

                        <p><strong>Proclaimed:</strong> Council of Florence (1439), Council of Trent (1563)</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In response to Protestantism that denied purgatory, the Council of Trent reaffirmed this doctrine, establishing that souls in purgatory can be helped by the prayers and suffrages of the faithful.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        The dogma of hell proclaims that hell is a state of eternal suffering for those who die in mortal sin without repentance. Hell consists in the eternal privation of the vision of God (penalty of loss) and in sufferings proportional to the sins committed (penalty of sense).

                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> The existence of hell was always part of Christian faith, establishing that the definitive rejection of God leads to eternal damnation. It was reaffirmed against theories that denied the eternity of hell.</p>

                        The dogma of the second coming of Christ proclaims that Jesus will return gloriously at the end of time to judge the living and the dead. This parousia (coming) will be visible and universal, marking the end of history and the beginning of the definitive kingdom of God.

                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> The second coming of Christ was always part of Christian faith from apostolic times, being mentioned in the Apostles' Creed and always defended by the Church as the hope and certainty of the faithful.</p>

                        The dogma of the resurrection of the dead proclaims that at the end of time, all the dead will rise with their bodies, which will be reunited with their souls. The just will rise with glorious bodies, while the condemned will rise for eternal damnation.

                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> The resurrection of the dead was always part of Christian faith, being mentioned in the Creed and always defended against philosophies that denied bodily resurrection, establishing that salvation involves both soul and body.</p>
