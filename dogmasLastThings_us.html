                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> Death is a consequence of original sin. The biblical account of the Fall (Gn 3) uses a language made of images, but affirms a primordial event, a fact that occurred at the beginning of human history. Revelation gives us the certainty of faith that all human history is marked by original sin freely committed by our first parents, bringing death as a consequence.
                    </p>
                    <div class="dogma-info">
                        <p><strong>When it was proclaimed:</strong> Information not officially recorded.</p>
                        <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Church Fathers, especially Saint Augustine</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> The Church has always taught that death entered the world as a consequence of original sin, establishing that physical death is the result of the disobedience of Adam and Eve, but that Christ conquered death through his resurrection.</p>
                        <p class="dogma-quote"><strong>Official or biblical citation:</strong> "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 6:23) / "Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin." (Romans 5:12)</p>
                        <p class="dogma-spiritual"><strong>Spiritual application:</strong> Recognize the reality of death as a consequence of sin, but live in the hope of eternal life offered by Christ, preparing for death through a holy life.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> The souls of the just, who at the instant of death are free from all guilt and penalty of sin, enter Heaven. Heaven is the state of eternal and perfect happiness in the presence of God. Those who die in a state of grace and without mortal sin enter immediately into heaven, where they enjoy the beatific vision, seeing God face to face and participating in his divine life.
                    </p>
                    <div class="dogma-info">
                        <p><strong>When it was proclaimed:</strong> From the first centuries, confirmed by the Council of Florence (1439)</p>
                        <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Church Fathers from the first centuries</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> Heaven was always understood as the final destination of the just. The Council of Florence defined that the souls of the saints enter immediately into heaven after death, enjoying the beatific vision.</p>
                        <p class="dogma-quote"><strong>Official or biblical citation:</strong> "Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world." (Matthew 25:34) / "Then I saw 'a new heaven and a new earth.'" (Revelation 21:1) / "What no eye has seen, what no ear has heard, and what no human mind has conceived—the things God has prepared for those who love him." (1 Corinthians 2:9)</p>
                        <p class="dogma-spiritual"><strong>Spiritual application:</strong> Live in the hope of heaven, seeking holiness and union with God in this life, to be able to enjoy the beatific vision in eternal life.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> The souls of those who die in a state of mortal sin go to hell. Hell is a state of eternal suffering for those who die in mortal sin without repentance. Hell consists in the eternal privation of the vision of God (penalty of loss) and in sufferings proportional to the sins committed (penalty of sense).
                    </p>
                    <div class="dogma-info">

                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> The existence of hell has always been part of Christian faith, establishing that the definitive rejection of God leads to eternal damnation. It was reaffirmed against theories that denied the eternity of hell.</p>
                        <p class="dogma-quote"><strong>Official or biblical citation:</strong> "Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels." (Matthew 25:41) / "If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out." (Mark 9:43) / "Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire." (Revelation 20:15)</p>
                        <p class="dogma-spiritual"><strong>Spiritual application:</strong> Fear hell and avoid mortal sin, always seeking conversion and reconciliation with God through the sacraments, especially confession.</p>

                    <p class="dogma-description">
                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> The souls of the just who at the instant of death are burdened by venial sins or by temporal penalties due for sin go to Purgatory. Purgatory is a state of purification. There exists a state of purification after death for those who die in a state of grace, but with venial sins not forgiven or with temporal debt of sins already forgiven. Purgatory is temporary and ends when the soul is completely purified.
                    </p>
                    <div class="dogma-info">
                        <p><strong>When it was proclaimed:</strong> Council of Florence (1439), Council of Trent (1563)</p>
                        <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Church Fathers from the first centuries</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> In response to Protestantism that denied purgatory, the Council of Trent reaffirmed this doctrine, establishing that souls in purgatory can be helped by the prayers and suffrages of the faithful.</p>
                        <p class="dogma-quote"><strong>Official or biblical citation:</strong> "Therefore he made atonement for the dead, that they might be absolved from their sin." (2 Maccabees 12:46) / "If it is burned up, the builder will suffer loss but yet will be saved—even though only as one escaping through the flames." (1 Corinthians 3:15)</p>
                        <p class="dogma-spiritual"><strong>Spiritual application:</strong> Pray for the souls in purgatory, offer masses and suffrages for them, and seek purification in this life through penance and good works, to avoid or reduce time in purgatory.</p>

                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> At the end of the world, Christ, surrounded by Majesty, will come again to judge men.

This parousia (coming) will be visible and universal, marking the end of history and the beginning of the definitive kingdom of God.

                        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong> The second coming of Christ has always been part of Christian faith since apostolic times, being mentioned in the Apostles' Creed and always defended by the Church as the hope and certainty of the faithful.</p>
                        <p class="dogma-quote"><strong>Official or biblical citation:</strong> "Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven.
